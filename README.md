# Arithmetic-expression-compilation
This project contains code for generating a arithmetic expression evaluator and three-address code
I used LEX and BESON for for generating respectively the scanner and the parser, and I tested all the code on Ubuntu 16.04
I implemented this functionalities:
* Evaluation a simple arithmetic expression whatever the combination of the four arithmetic operator: +, -,  *, /
* We can embed any number of parenthesis level
* Some basic function on list of numbers as mean, variance, standard error, max ...
* A three-address code generator
